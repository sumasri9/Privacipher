Hi █████:

My name is ██████████ and I work for t██ Legal Research Center ("LRC") in
Minneapolis.  As you may know, we are t██ nation's leading provider of
outsourced legal research and writing services.  Recently, we have entered
into a strategic business alliance with Integrity Interactive Corporation
("IIC"), to offer industry-leading, online compliance training - training
that could ██lp Enron save millions in t██ event of a DOJ prosecution.
LRC's role in this alliance is to provide t██ legal research content for t██
compliance courses and assist in t██ marketing and selling of t██ IIC
product.

You can view our compliance modules at work or home, as long as you have
access to t██ internet and a personal access code.  To receive an access
code or more information, please call (████████████) or send me a reply
email.  Thank you for your time and have a great day!
