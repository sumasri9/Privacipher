000/2001 Winter Season



As a result of feedback received at t██ ██████ reliability collaborative,
██████████ has made t██ following changes to its capacity release/delivery
service programs for t██ 2000/2001 winter season.

First, to assist you in meeting your primary point obligations relating to
t██ firm load on our system that you are serving, ██████████ will make
available to Marketers 25,000 dt/day on ███████.  Your allocation based on
active customers in your group as of ████████████ is
511 dt/day in t██ form of eit██r:

  (a) a capacity release of ███████ capacity at t██
███████ maximum
   rate for t██ 12-month period ███████████00 through
██████████01,
   or

  (b) a bundled citygate sale for ███████████00 through
████████01 priced
   as follows:

*  Inside F.E.R.C.=01,s first of t██ month index price at
    ███████/Zone 3 (Station 65) plus $1.00/dt.

 or;

  (c) a combination of t██ two adding up to 511 dt per
day.


Second, in addition to t██ above, we can make available to you 204 dt/day
during ████████01 as a bundled citygate sale on t██ same terms as set forth
above.

Third, with respect to t██ balance of capacity that you may require to meet
your primary point obligations,

  (a) T██re will be no citygate allocation requirements
for this winter, except for t██ 25% limitation on Texas Eastern. (i.e., you
may deliver     all of your gas to any of t██
following receipt points, except that no more than 25% may be delivered to
Texas Eastern.

       ███████ (██████████████ 134th Street - Manhattan, Central Manhattan, Narrows or Long Beach)

       Tennessee (██████████████  White Plains)

  (b) We will permit you to meet t██ primary point
requirement using your Daily Load Following Service Quantity (for Load
Following Service)  or Daily Load Quantity (for Daily Delivery Service)
during November instead of t██ Average Day/Peak Month quantity used during
t██ remaining four winter months.

  (c) Prior to t██ winter, you can trade all or part of
your citygate allocation on Texas Eastern to anot██r marketer, so long as
t██ aggregate entitlement for deliveries on Texas Eastern among all
marketers remains below 25% of t██ combined total allocation.

Please let us know on or before close of business Friday, █████████████
which, if any, of t██ above-described services you are interested in.

NOTES:
1. We will advise you if additional capacity becomes available as a
result of actions taken by ot██r marketers.
2. Bundled sales service is subject to t██ execution of a written
agreement (on mutually agreeable terms), including a take-or-pay commitment
and resolution of any creditworthiness issues.
